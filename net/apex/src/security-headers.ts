/*
 * `style-src` is `'self'` alone.
 *
 * It used to carry a sha256 of an inline `<style>` alongside `'self'`, which
 * bought nothing: `'self'` was already present, so a same-origin stylesheet was
 * already permitted, and the digest had to be recomputed by hand — and pinned
 * by its own test — every time a single character of the CSS changed. The CSS
 * is now a compiled static asset served from this origin, so the hash is gone
 * and the policy is the narrower of the two.
 *
 * `styleSrcAttr: 'none'` still forbids inline `style="…"` attributes, which is
 * why every visual rule in this unit is a Tailwind class.
