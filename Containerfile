# Tailscale, for an interactive `tailscale up` in a shell in this container.
#
# The client is baked into the image rather than run as a sidecar: `core` itself
# joins the tailnet, in userspace-networking mode, which needs no /dev/net/tun,
# no NET_ADMIN and no root, so `cap_drop: ALL` and `no-new-privileges` hold
# unchanged. Nothing starts it automatically and no SSH server rides along --
# `tailscale up` prints a login URL and the developer signs in, the same way
# every other credential in this container is obtained.
#
# The version is pinned: keep it in step with the `tailscale` client on the host
# so the two behave the same, and bump it deliberately.

# Corepack is removed, not merely unused. Node ships it only up to (not

# container can never run: no systemd, `cap_drop: ALL`, and `no-new-privileges`

# instead -- running as the login account, `--tun=userspace-networking`, no
# capability needed -- and starts that daemon on first use, so a plain

# the image needs from the host besides the build context itself, and a heredoc

# 0555 under root ownership, so the workspace bind -- which `edge` owns and any
# development shell can write -- cannot influence what a `tailscale` call runs.

# Standalone install per https://pnpm.io/installation. This is the single source
# of pnpm in the image: it needs no root, so it runs after the USER switch and
# lands under $HOME rather than /usr/local.
#
# The PATH above ends in `/bin` for a reason. pnpm 11 moved every global binary
# into a `bin` subdirectory of PNPM_HOME and 12 keeps that layout — the install
# script runs `pnpm setup`,
# which installs the CLI with `pnpm add -g` and writes `pn`/`pnpx`/`pnx` there
# too, then deletes the v10-era shims that used to sit in PNPM_HOME itself.
# Pointing PATH at PNPM_HOME directly, as the v10 layout required, leaves this
# image with no pnpm at all.
#
# `pnpm setup` also has to identify the shell it is configuring, which it does
# from $SHELL — so this must stay below the ENV block that sets it. It writes a
# PATH line into ~/.bashrc as well; that is redundant here because PATH is baked
# into the image, but harmless, and suppressing it is not worth diverging from
# the documented install.
#
# PNPM_VERSION is pinned to the same version package.json declares under
# devEngines.packageManager; test/development-container-security.test.ts fails
# if the two ever drift apart.

# the named volume `pnpm-store` over that store at runtime, hiding the image's
# copy behind an empty volume. The symlink then dangles and every `pn`/`pnpm`
# invocation fails with "exec: .../@pnpm/exe/pnpm: not found". Dereference it
# here so the global install is self-contained and survives the mount.
#
# The `global/v*` glob stays version-agnostic on purpose: pnpm bumps that
# directory with its major, and a hardcoded `v11` would silently match nothing
# on the next upgrade — the loop would skip, the build would still succeed, and
# only a container with the volume mounted would fail.
