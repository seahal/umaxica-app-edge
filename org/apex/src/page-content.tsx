/**
 * A UMAXICA domain and what it is for.
 *
 * A host name is an identifier the reader may retype into an address bar, not
 * running copy, so it is set in the monospace family throughout this unit —
 * here, in the homepage heading, and in the health document's data column. The
 * purpose beside it is prose and stays in the body face. That split is the one
 * typographic decision this surface carries: everything else is the shared
 * token set in docs/design/ui-shell-contract.md §9.
 *
 * `--font-mono` is Tailwind's stock stack rather than a token declared in
 * `@theme`. Unlike `--font-sans`, which is named explicitly because Japanese
 * body text depends on which face resolves, every string set in mono here is
 * ASCII — a host name or a version id — so the stock stack has nothing to get
 * wrong and this unit still downloads no font.

/**
 * The sibling domains, as a directory rather than a bullet list.
 *
 * This is the substance of the page: an apex host exists to say which UMAXICA
 * domain you are on and where the others are. A bare `<ul>` of underlined
 * links gave that no more weight than a footnote, and gave a phone user a
 * target the height of one line of text.
 *
 * Each row is one link covering the whole row — `min-h-11` is the 44px target
 * from §9 — with the host and its purpose on one baseline. It wraps to two
 * lines on a narrow viewport by `flex-wrap` alone, so this adds no media query
 * and §11's "apex emits none at all" still holds.
 *
 * The hover state is a surface step to `bg-white`, the same surface the header
 * and footer sit on, plus an underline on the host. Both are inside
 * `group-hover` so that hovering anywhere on the row — including the purpose
 * text, which is not itself a link — shows the whole row is the target. The
 * negative margin bleeds that surface past the text column so the copy above
 * and the host names below stay on one left edge.

 * Two things on this page were wrong rather than merely plain, and both are

 *
 * The host is set as mono text, not as a link to itself. It used to be an
 * `<a>` pointing at this very origin, which everywhere was a control returning
 * the reader to where they already are. It is a label now, which is what it
 * always was.
 *
 * And the page no longer claims the domain "is not operated as a public-facing
 * website", because on none of the five was that true. On the three
 * redirectors `/` answers 301 to a regional host, so this domain is exactly
 * how a visitor reaches the service; on `net` and `dev` it serves an
 * `index,follow` homepage of its own. The sentence also contradicted the
 * `<meta name="description">` this same page emits — "a UMAXICA platform
 * domain. Services and content are..." — so the page disagreed with itself in
 * a way only a reader comparing the two would ever notice. The body now says
 * what the description says.
